    <h1>Well-Implemented</h1>
    <p>The use of color is consistent and doesn't intefere with the layout.<br>
        The use of images doesn't overwhelm the text on each page. <br>
        The navigation is simple, smooth, and not complicated.
    </p>
    <h1>Improvements</h1>
    <p>There are several fonts being used, one for the heading and the other for the paragraphs. It makes the heading not fit with the paragraphs. <br>
        The color on some of the fonts make it harder to read, along with the fact that the font size is too small. <br>
        Some paragraphs are harder to read because they are not evenly spaced from its accompaning header.
    </p>
    <h1>Other Improvements</h1>
    <p>The navigation bar could stand out more with a diffent background and a border around each page title to make it easier to navagate. <br>
        There should be a page with the location on a map and address, and another page for contacting in case you have difficulty with the service.
